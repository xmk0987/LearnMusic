        "content": "Notes are the building blocks of music. They represent specific pitches, which are the sounds we hear. In Western music, there are 12 unique notes: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, and G#. These notes repeat in higher or lower pitches, forming what we call octaves.",

        "title": "Reading the Stave",
        "content": "The stave (or staff) is a set of five horizontal lines where musical notes are placed. The position of a note on the stave tells us its pitch. Higher notes are written higher on the stave, and lower notes are written lower. Notes can be placed on lines or in spaces between them. The treble clef (ùÑû) and bass clef (ùÑ¢) are commonly used to indicate different ranges of notes.",

        "title": "Major Scales",
        "content": "A major scale is a series of seven notes with a specific pattern of whole and half steps (intervals). The pattern is: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. Whole step means to go two keys up or down, including the black keys, and Half step is just going to the next key. For example, the C major scale consists of the notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and then back to C.",

            "content": "Each major scale has a relative minor scale. The relative minor scale consists of all the same notes as the major scale, but starts with the relative minor key. You can find the relative minor scale by looking at the 6th note of the major scale or by going three half steps down of your major scales root note."
